<h2>Assignment</h2></br>
<h4><p>Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a 
large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part 
of the quantified self movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly 
to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing 
that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify 
how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, 
arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 
different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har 
(see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).</p></h4>
</br>
<h2>Data Collection</h2></br>
<h4><p>The training data for this project are available here: 
[https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv]</br>
The test data are available here: 
[https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv]</br>
The data for this project come from this source: 
[http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har]. If you use the document you create 
for this class for any purpose please cite them as they have been very generous 
in allowing their data to be used for this kind of assignment.</p></h4>
</br>
<h2>My Submission</h2></br>
<h4><p>The goal of your project is to predict how well they did the exercise. This is the 
“classe” variable in the training set. You may use any of the other variables to predict with. You 
should create a report describing how you built your model, how you used cross validation, what you 
think the expected out of sample error is, and why you made the choices you did. You will also use your 
prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.</br>

Your submission should consist of a link to a Github repo with your R markdown and compiled HTML file 
describing your analysis. Please constrain the text of the writeup to < 2000 words and the number of 
figures to be less than 5. It will make it easier for the graders if you submit a repo with a gh-pages 
branch so the HTML page can be viewed online (and you always want to make it easy on graders :-).
You should also apply your machine learning algorithm to the 20 test cases available in the test data above. 
Please submit your predictions in appropriate format to the programming assignment for automated grading. See 
the programming assignment for additional details.</p></h4>

<h2>My Reasoning</h2></br>
<h3>Reproduceability</h3></br>
<h4><p>An overall pseudo-random number generator seed was set at 12345 for all the code in order to 
reproduce the results. Different packages should be downloaded and installed such as caret,randomForest, rpart for reproducibility purpose</p></h4></br>
</br>
<h3>How the model was built</h3>
<h4><p>The variable that will determine how well each subject will do a particular exercise is the variable "classe", 
a factor variable with 5 levels (e.g. A, B, C, D, E), where:</br>
- exactly according to the specification (Class A)</br>
- throwing the elbows to the front (Class B)</br>
- lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C)</br>
- lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D)</br>
- throwing the hips to the front (Class E)</br>
Class A corresponds to the specified execution of the exercise, while the other 4 classes correspond to common mistakes." 
Prediction evaluations will be based on maximizing the accuracy and minimizing the out-of-sample error. All other available 
variables after cleaning will be used for prediction. Two models will be tested using decision tree and random forest 
algorithms. The model with the highest accuracy will be chosen as our final model.</p></h4></br>
</br>
<h3>Cross-validation</h3>
<h4><p>Cross-validation will be performed by subsampling our training data set randomly without replacement into 2 
subsamples: subTraining data (75% of the original Training data set) and subTesting data (25%). Our models will be fitted 
on the subTraining data set, and tested on the subTesting data. Once the most accurate model is choosen, it will be tested 
on the original Testing data set.</p></h4></br>
</br>
<h3>Expected out-of-sample error</h3>
<h4><p>The expected out-of-sample error will correspond to the quantity: 1-accuracy in the cross-validation data. Accuracy 
is the proportion of correct classified observation over the total sample in the subTesting data set. Expected accuracy is 
the expected accuracy in the out-of-sample data set (i.e. original testing data set). Thus, the expected value of the 
out-of-sample error will correspond to the expected number of missclassified observations/total observations in the Test 
data set, which is the quantity: 1-accuracy found from the cross-validation data set.</p></h4></br>
</br>
<h3>Reasons for my choices</h3>
<h4><p>Our outcome variable “classe” is an unordered factor variable. Thus, we can choose our error type as 1-accuracy. 
We have a large sample size with N= 19622 in the Training data set. This allow us to divide our Training sample into 
subTraining and subTesting to allow cross-validation. Features with all missing values will be discarded as well as features 
that are irrelevant. All other features will be kept as relevant variables.
Decision tree and random forest algorithms are known for their ability of detecting the features that are important for 
classification. Feature selection is inherent, so it is not so necessary at the data preparation phase. Thus, there won’t 
be any feature selection section in this report.</p></h4></br>
